## Projects

### [Downloads folder cleaner - Python Project](https://github.com/kyrchris/AutoFileOrganizer/tree/main)

• This Python script, leveraging the `watchdog` library, monitors and organizes the user's Downloads folder. Specifically designed for macOS users, it intelligently categorizes documents based on file extensions and cleans up the folder by moving them to the 'output_folder'. Notably, it excludes files named 'output_folder' or '.DS_Store' from processing.
<br>
The script is ideal for users looking to automate and declutter their Downloads folder, providing a streamlined solution for document categorization and cleanup.
