## Projects

### [Downloads folder cleaner - Python Project](https://github.com/kyrchris/AutoFileOrganizer/tree/main)

• This Python script, leveraging the `watchdog` library, monitors and organizes the user's Downloads folder. Specifically designed for macOS users, it intelligently categorizes documents based on file extensions and cleans up the folder by moving them to the 'output_folder'. Notably, it excludes files named 'output_folder' or '.DS_Store' from processing.

The script is ideal for users looking to automate and declutter their Downloads folder, providing a streamlined solution for document categorization and cleanup.

### [Data Exploration Shiny App - R Project](https://github.com/kyrchris/Data_Exploration_Shiny_app)

• The Data Exploration Shiny App is a dynamic Shiny application designed to streamline data analysis processes. It empowers users to upload XLSX or CSV files and delve into their datasets through an array of interactive features. Leveraging core packages such as shiny, dplyr, and ggplot2, this tool enables users to select variables, apply filters, and generate insightful visualizations with ease. With its intuitive interface and robust functionalities, users can navigate complex datasets efficiently, gaining valuable insights into their data distributions and trends. Developed to enhance coding skills and showcase proficiency in R programming, this app stands as a testament to the power of data visualization and exploration in decision-making processes.

### [CV Creator - Python Project](https://github.com/kyrchris/CV_Builder)

• The CV Creator script is a personal project aimed at automating the creation of professional CVs. Developed as part of my journey to enhance my Python coding skills, this project guides users through input prompts to gather their personal information, work experience, education, computer skills, internships, and languages. Leveraging the python-docx library, it dynamically generates a formatted CV document in Microsoft Word (.docx) format, offering a structured and visually appealing layout to present the user's information. This project serves as a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and proficiency in Python, showcasing my ability to utilize third-party libraries for practical applications.
